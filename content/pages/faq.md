1. Can I use Flowty for free?
    - No. Flowty cannot be used for free. If you’d like to see how it works, schedule a demo using [this calendar link](https://savvycal.com/fershad/9ea168b3).
2. Can I still update my site after using Flowty?
    - Yes, you can continue to use Webflow’s designer & editor to maintain your site just as you normally do.
3. Will my Flowty site update if I make changes in Webflow?
    - You’ll be able to connect your Flowty site to Webflow [using webhooks](/webhooks/), to ensure your production site remains up-to-date whenever you make changes in Webflow.
4. Do I need to keep a Webflow Site Plan?
    - If you don’t need any of Webflow’s advanced features, then no you do not need a paid Webflow Site Plan. If you are a heavy Webflow forms user, or using CMS or eCommerce functionality, then you will need a paid Webflow Site Plan for those functions to work on your Flowty site.
5. Where can I host my Flowty site?
    - You can [host your Flowty site anywhere](/hosting/) that can run NodeJS and serve static HTML web pages. If you want, you can even host it on your own Raspberry Pi device powered by solar panels!
6. What can't Flowty optimise?
    - There are still a few things that Flowty can't automatically optimise. This includes Lottie animations, iframes and emdedded content, and third-party content. When working with these elements, you will need to make decisions on how you use them in order to keep your site sustainable.
7. Do Webflow's forms still work?
    - Yes, they will still work based on the limits of your site’s Webflow plan.
8. Can I edit or do more to the code?
    - You can run the Flowty code locally, and make any further modifications you need. Please note, this approach will mean you must manually update the version of Flowty your site uses.
9. Can I get help with further Webflow optimisations?
    - Yes, absolutely! If you’d like a performance audit of your Webflow design, or want a quick consulting call, email [hello@flowty.site](mailto:hello@flowty.site).
10. Can I see a demo?
    - Sure! Schedule a demo using [this calendar link](https://savvycal.com/fershad/9ea168b3).
