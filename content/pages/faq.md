1. Does using Flowty on my site violate [Webflow's Terms of Service](https://webflow.com/legal/terms)?
    - Yes. Flowty crawls and scrapes your Webflow staging site. This [is not permitted](https://webflow.com/legal/terms#:~:text=with%20adult%20themes.-,Use%20of%20the%20Service,-Your%20use%20of) under Webflow's Terms of Service. By using Flowty on your site, you accept and understand this.
2. Can I still update my site after using Flowty?
    - Yes, you can continue to use Webflow’s designer & editor to maintain your site just as you normally do.
3. Will my Flowty site update if I make changes in Webflow?
    - You’ll be able to connect your Flowty site to Webflow [using webhooks](/webhooks/), to ensure your production site remains up-to-date whenever you make changes in Webflow.
5. Where can I host my Flowty site?
    - You can [host your Flowty site anywhere](/hosting/) that can run NodeJS and serve static HTML web pages. If you want, you can even host it on your own Raspberry Pi device powered by solar panels!
6. What can't Flowty optimise?
    - There are still a few things that Flowty can't automatically optimise. This includes Lottie animations, iframes and emdedded content, and third-party content. When working with these elements, you will need to make decisions on how you use them in order to keep your site sustainable.
7. Do Webflow's forms still work?
    - Yes, they will still work based on the limits of your site’s Webflow plan.
9. Can I get help with using Flowty?
    - Flowty is not actively maintained. If you need help then you can contact [hello@flowty.site](mailto:hello@flowty.site), and I will try to get back to you in due course.
