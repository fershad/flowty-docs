The **Website settings** tab allows you to:

- Set a name for your site that makes it easier to recognise when you login to Flowty. (It won't be used anywhere else.)
- Find and copy your site ID. You'll need this when [publishing your site](/hosting/).
- Change your site's Webflow Staging URL.
- Set a custom domain for your site.
- [Add webhooks](/webhooks/) to trigger site builds when you make changes in Flowty.
