Adding custom code to your site is currently only possible with a Webflow Site plan. Flowty allows you to add custom code snippets to the `head` and `body` sections of your site. This gives you a way to add custom functionality, analytics scripts, and other services your site.

In your site's dashboard, navigate to the **Custom code** tab. Here you will see two textareas where you can added code snippets to be inject into your site's `head` or `body` sections respectively.
