Flowty tries to find all the pages you have created in Webflow. Sometimes it might not be able to find orphaned pages which are not linked to from other pages. Currently, there are two ways you can ensure these pages are found:

- Link to the page/s from another page that Flowty has found.
- [Email me](mailto:support@flowty.site), and I will add the page/s to your site's configuration.

*There will eventually be a way for you to add missing pages via the Flowty Dashboard.*
