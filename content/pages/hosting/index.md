  title: Connect to a hosting service
---

With your [git repository setup](/upload-to-git/), you can now connect your Flowty site to a hosting service and get your site online!

We recommend using [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), or another [green hosting provider](https://www.thegreenwebfoundation.org/directory/), to host your site.

At a minimum, your hosting provider should be able to:

- Run a `node version 16` environment
- Serve static HTML files and other assets

## Guides
Below are guides for setting up a Flowty site with popular cloud hosting providers.
