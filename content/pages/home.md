Flowty is the Webflow optimisation tool for the carbon conscious designers. Build in Webflow, optimise with Flowty, host where you want.

Flowty’s code takes your Webflow site, runs the pages through the Eleventy static site generator, and applies a series of optimisations to the page content and assets. The output is good old fashioned HTML files. This allows sites to be hosted almost anywhere.

You still use Webflow’s design and editing tools to build, publish, and maintain sites. Flowty takes care of optimising your site.

## Requirements

- A Webflow website
- A host running Node version 16 or higher
